# DOM-JavaScript-basics

This is a quick example of how DOM can be used to manipulate HTML.

DOM is an abbreviation, and it stands for Document Object Model. 
This basically means your HTML is divided into elements, attributes and text.
These DOM objects can be manipulated in JavaScript. 

-JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page  
-JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page   
-JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page      
-JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes   
-JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes       
-JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page     
-JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

In this example I'll demonstrate how to show a list of albums in HTML through 
DOM in JavaScript. The main focus is the app.js file in the js directory. The CSS is 
not yet determined, so feel free to play around with that as well.
